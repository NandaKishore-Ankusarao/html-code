    <h2>About Birth</h2>
    <p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[9] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[10] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father to bowl to him.[11]

        In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[12] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.[13] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[14] He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[15] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[13]
        
        On 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.[13][16] During his childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's presence at times.[10][17] According to his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.[13] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.[18]</p>

    <h2>Cricket Career</h2>
    <p>2008–2009: Debut and maiden stint
        In August 2008, Kohli was included in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his belt.[29] So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".[30] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series.[31] On August 18, 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.[32] However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli scored his inaugural half century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.[33]
        
        Following the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[34] Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he participated in, scoring 49 runs.[35] In October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board President's XI team. The match featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating his ability to perform against high-level international competition.[36]
        
        In November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the squad for the home ODI series against England. However, he was not given an opportunity to play in any of the matches.[37] In December 2008, Kohli was awarded a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as part of the annual contract list for the Indian national team which entitled him to receive ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹4.2 million or US$50,000 in 2023).[38] Despite being awarded a contract, in January, Kohli was dropped for the five-match ODl series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.[39]
        
        In July–August 2009, Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament, held in Australia. He was selected to open the innings for the Indian Emerging Players team in the tournament, and he went on to have a standout performance. Kohli finished as the tournament's leading run-scorer, with a total of 398 runs from seven matches, at an average of 66.33. He was particularly impressive in the final match, where he scored 104 runs off 102 balls against the South Africa Emerging Players team in Brisbane. His strong performance helped lead his team to a 17-run victory and the tournament title.[40][41] At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of the Indian national selection committee, expressed his admiration for Kohli's performance during the tournament.[42] Kohli later stated that this tournament was a "turning point" in his career.[43]
        
        In August 2009, Kohli returned to the national team after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[44] He was also utilized as a middle order batsman in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy due to an injury sustained by Yuvraj Singh.[45] In December of that year, he was included in the team for home ODI series against Sri Lanka and scored 27 and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj, who regained fitness for the third ODI.[46] However, due to the reoccurrence of a finger injury, Yuvraj was ruled out indefinitely, which led to Kohli's return to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata.[47] In that match, Kohli scored his maiden ODI century–107 off 114 balls–while sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir. As a result of this performance, India won by seven wickets and sealed the series 3–1.[48][a]</p>
